## Scenario Planning

- Decide what the exchange is about
- Who are the exchange partners?
- Who are stakeholders?
- Communication is key

	Sender ->> Receiver: So we send you A, B, and C.
	Receiver ->> Sender: We don't use C. We throw it away. We really need D.
	Sender ->> Receiver: What? C is hard to generate. D is easy!
	Receiver ->> Sender: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

- Existing exchanges or other documentation can help
	- Within your organization
	- From NIEM repositories (_huge caveat_)
	- There's a community to draw from
