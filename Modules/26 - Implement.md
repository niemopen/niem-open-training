# Implementation

- Remember that NIEM is just the payload
	- It’s just plain old XML
		- Well, okay, with referencing
	- Or it’s just plain JSON
		- Well, okay, with JSON-LD
- Remember the scope of NIEM
	- Things outside the payload aren't NIEM
	- You don’t have to do anything special for NIEM outside NIEM’s scope

## Skill level to Implement NIEM
- Developers with the skills to design and implement a data exchange can learn the NIEM approach in a matter of hours
- Developer training is available
- Plenty of example IEPDs to follow
	- Hard to find right now
	- _Will_ get better
- Don’t start from scratch, leverage shared IEPDs
- The NIEM technical specifications are complex, however
	- Most developers do not need to read them
	- Free tools can perform most of the conformance checking
		- Schematron directly
		- [Conformance Testing Assistant (ConTesA)](https://tools.niem.gov/contesa/)
