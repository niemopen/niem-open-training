## Map and Model

For this entire mapping process, we'll look at various things in the mapping spreadsheet and show how to map them to NIEM or to new elements that we'll create later. As we move through, we'll cover all the major aspects of how NIEM works.

### Introduction to Mapping

- Mapping Spreadsheets Options
	- NIEM Mapping Template
	- Custom Spreadsheet
- Mapping Process
	- Document Business Objects
	- Map them to NIEM objects, existing or new
	- While maintaining an Ongoing Sample Instance Skeleton
___
### NIEM Mapping Template

- Primarily for submitting content for inclusion in NIEM
	- Eight different tabs
- Can also be used for mapping in a Message Spec / IEPD
	- Just need a few of the tabs, mainly Property and Type
- Is a bit overkill for a Message Spec
- Slight difference between the versions on the NIEM site and for use with MEP Builder
- [Mapping Spreadsheet Template](/Mapping_Spreadsheets/niem-mapping-template.xlsx)
___
### Custom Mapping Spreadsheet

- Has evolved over time
- Contains all the info needed to make schemas
- Not as overwhelming as the NIEM Mapping Template
- You can make your own custom one
	- The Message Spec / IEPD Spec doesnâ€™t specify a required format, by design
- Fresh copy for our example Message Spec / IEPD
